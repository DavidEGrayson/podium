podium
======

Our hacknight project, a future replacement for soapbox.

To get started developing:

1. Make a fork of the [LasVegasRubyGroup/podium](https://github.com/LasVegasRubyGroup/podium) repository on your github account.
2. Clone the github repository to your computer.
3. Install Ruby 2.0.0.  This version is specified in our Gemfile.
4. Run `gem install bundler`
5. Run `bundle`
6. Install node.js and phantomjs.  These are external packages that our test suite uses and cannot be installed with bundler.
7. Run `rake` and make sure all the examples succeed.
